To run the bot, you need to have node.js installed first. If you haven't installed it yet, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Also you need a bot token. If you haven't created one yet, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/ and create a new application. Then, go to the "Bot" tab, click on "Add Bot" and copy the token. **KEEP THIS TOKEN PRIVATE!**
